# Telegram Notification Tool Setup Guide

This tool allows you to input specific keywords and the IDs of certain Telegram stickers. It monitors all your Telegram messages, and if any message contains one of the specified keywords or a sticker with a matching ID, the tool triggers a bot to send you a Telegram notification with the message link and details.

This functionality is especially useful during competitions, as you can set up your desired keywords or stickers instead of manually monitoring every notification. **Note:** You must enable bot notifications for the tool to work.

Additionally, the tool includes a **"How it Works"** button. Clicking it will redirect you to tutorial videos that explain how to set it up step-by-step.
